          Jesuit education is inspired by the vision of a human being drawn from the life and teachings of Jesus Christ,
          who has always been respected and admired by the people of India. It is based on the principles of character
          formation elaborated by Ignatius of Loyola. This vision and these principles give Jesuit Institutions a
          specific character and set before the Staff and Students ideals of humanism and service towards which they are
          invited continually to strive after. This Jesuit School aims at the integral formation of the young and to
          accomplish this special efforts are made:

          To help the students become mature, spiritually oriented, women and men of character;
          To encourage them to strive after excellence in every field;
          To value and judiciously use their human freedom;
          To be unselfish in the service of their fellow human beings;
          To become agents of social change in the country.
          This Jesuit school thus aims at making its own contribution towards the radical transformation of present day
          social conditions, so that the principles of social justice, equality of opportunity, genuine freedom, respect
          for religious and moral values enshrined in the Constitution of India may prevail and the possibility of
          living a fully human existence may be open to al

        </h5>
        <p> Days after teen climate activist Greta Thunberg’s rousing UN speech about climate action, the environmental
          crisis debate was picked up at a timely inter-college debate at the city's most esteemed educational
          institution. Xavier's Management Society along with St. Xavier's College Kolkata presents X - Confero, in
          association with Indulge, powered by One Plus, raised the issue of sustainable development and the
          prioritisation of the economy over pollution control in a developing country and saw two teams engage in a
          Cambridge-style war of words.

          The format was simple, to persuade the larger percentage of people in the auditorium to agree with your side
          of the argument. It was stated at the beginning of the debate that the house believes that economic
          development should be prioritised over pollution control and 41 people from the auditorium sided with the
          house. The proposing team was The Accidental Participants (comprising Deep Mehta, Vani Dugar and Somok Sur)
          and the opposing team was Team Rejects 3.0 (comprising Priya Chatterjee Ray, Pranav Dhupia and Hamid Aziz).

          "We've often heard how important climate change is, and how important it is to control pollution, but imagine
          yourself as the head of state or as a policy-maker, that's when you realize that all of this has to do with
          the quality of life and the standard of living. When you're talking about a country like our's which is a
          developing one, we have factories being set up, the technological influx, and incomes being generated. The
          government's priority is to make sure that we become a developed country like the west where you have economic
          equity and better infrastructure, and there's skewness in the facilities which are provided to the people. It
          is in this regard we tell you that pollution control and economic growth are complementary. While you have
          economic development, you have the control of pollution being facilitated by the process of it," Mehta
          remarked.

          Some practical facts about policy reforms were brought up by members of Team Rejects 3.0. "We are trying to
          develop towards a future that may not exist at all. On the Environmental Protection Index India is at 174 out
          of 178 countries. On the Air Quality Index, a country like Brazil which is also a developing country is 154
          out of 178. This arises as there has been no prioritisation of pollution control, and we have not believed in
          sustainable development. When they tell us that when we have proper economic growth only then can we have
          pollution control, that is not true. When we prioritise environmental policy over everything else, only then
          can we assure an efficient resource allocation," said Priya Chatterjee Ray, who also cited Thunberg as part of
          her argument.

          After an impressive round of debates, The Accidental Participants, who already had a headstart with the
          audience’s favour, were able to change the minds of 10 more people, as 51 people agreed with them by the end
          of the debate. The judges’ decision was also on the same page, and the team was declared the winner for
          X-Confero.

          “Where is the Indian economy headed? To understand that, we have to begin by asking, where is the Indian
          economy today? Some of you who are students will venture overseas and visit countries abroad and you will come
          back and ask, ‘why cannot India be like those countries?’ An entirely legitimate question to ask, provided you
          compare apples and apples, and oranges and oranges,” remarked Debroy as part of his speech. The economist and
          author brought many interesting perspectives to light, in context of income, infrastructure and the economic
          priorities of the population especially when it comes to a developing country like India.
